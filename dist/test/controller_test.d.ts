/**
 * Controller Test
 * by Rohan Kanhaisingh
 *
 * -----------------------
 *
 * This example demonstrates how you can use gamepad controllers
 * and handle their data.
 *
 * This is really cool because it gives non keyboard users
 * the ability to play games using this library as well.
 *
 * This example uses the most important classes which are:
 * - GamepadHandler
 * - GamepadController
 *
 * The GamepadHandler handles every gamepad that gets
 * connected or disconnected. Each GamepadHandler stores
 * GamepadController instances.
 *
 * When a gamepad controller gets connected, the .AddEventListener("connect")
 * method gets triggered passing a new fresh created GamepadController
 * class instance.
 *
 * This instance can be used to read data for example the pressed buttons
 * and other input data.
